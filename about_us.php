							<h4 class="red">Andrew Bradley – Trainer North2South Training Consultants Ltd</h4>

							<p>Hello my name is Andrew Bradley and I am pleased to be working with Hayley delivering courses with North2South Training Consultants.</p>

							<p>I come to training via a uniformed services background having worked with North Yorkshire Police for 24 years. During my service I had many experiences of working in emergency situations and I know only too well the benefits of having some knowledge of first aid skills. My Police beat was set in a very beautiful rural part of the country but that often meant I was the first emergency response at the scene of many incidents. I had the responsibility of assessing casualties and preserving life until the much welcomed arrival of the real experts. Our force piloted the use of defibrillators which meant that I was trained and carried an AED in my patrol car, it gave me the confidence that I could do the best for any unfortunate casualty. Latterly in my service I worked with numerous young people as a Youth Officer. Each year I helped to organise a fortnights event for every Year 6 primary school child across our district to attend. My first priority each year was to ensure we had our colleagues from YAS to help deliver the recovery position workshop.</p>

							<p>In preparation for my retirement from the Police in 2012 I studied for my Certificate in Education and then I started work teaching at the local Further Education college. I have gained some invaluable experience preparing, designing and delivering a number of different courses at the college.</p>

							<p>I live in the Yorkshire Dales and was an original member of the Malhamdale First Responder group. These are the community based groups who are trained to deliver initial defib and oxygen treatment in partnership with the Ambulance service. These groups provide swift response in their own communities until the arrival of the ambulance crews.</p>
