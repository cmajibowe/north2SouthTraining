              	<p>We strongly recommend that as many employees as possible take the 1 day EFAW course due to different shift patterns on different weeks, in different departments, so you will always have cover no matter if day or night, restaurant/bar, housekeeping, maintenance or office. This is ideal for seasonal staff and smaller workplaces that present few health & safety risks and less than 100 employees.</p>
